# Shiva K

**Enterprise Technology Advisor · Fractional CTO · Cloud, Data & GenAI Systems Architect**  
Helping engineering leaders deliver resilient, scalable, and AI-ready platforms.

---

I'm a hands-on technologist with 12+ years of experience guiding product and platform scale across enterprises, growth-stage startups, and global SaaS teams. My work focuses on:

- **Platform modernization** — re-architecting systems to support scale, velocity, and cross-geo delivery  
- **AI/LLM strategy** — designing production-grade GenAI systems with LangChain, Pinecone, and agentic patterns  
- **Data engineering** — building unified data pipelines, observability layers, and analytics at scale  
- **Cloud-native delivery** — infrastructure as code, multi-cloud governance, and ops automation  
- **Org & execution design** — helping CTOs scale engineering orgs and align product, platform, and roadmap strategy

I’ve partnered with tech leaders across the US, India, and EMEA to solve foundational scale challenges — whether preparing for a $B+ exit, enabling AI adoption, or realigning delivery playbooks.

## Work Style

I typically engage via long-term retainer with executive stakeholders (CTOs, CPOs, Heads of Eng). I operate independently or alongside internal teams, offering architectural clarity, technical oversight, and delivery support where needed. Always outcome-driven, never vendor-biased.
